<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Top leadership skills as we move into 2020</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;A fish rots from the head down&#8217;, goes an age-old adage. As someone in a corporate leadership position what this wise and time tested observation has meant to me is that an organization&#8217;s failures often originate at the top. On the other hand an effective leader can positively impact not just their immediate subordinates but the entire organization. As we approach 2020, some of the challenges that corporate leaders are forced to reckon with include technological disruption and ever-changing workplace dynamics. To my mind, the only response that is effective in such a scenario is for a leader to constantly revisit and revise their existing skill-set, to better reflect the complexities of our contemporary work culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Changing circumstances</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the current socio-economic climate, characterized by market volatility and uncertainties, organizations are pouring billions of dollars into leadership development. At a slightly less organized level, the internet is also rife with self-help leadership content, catering to a growing demand. However, rapid technological advancement and changing expectations often render a lot of this content obsolete, just as rapidly. Things are further complicated by the fact that workforces now consist of much greater diversity in opinions and backgrounds, than they have perhaps ever included. As Generation Z enters the workforce in large numbers, and professionals aged 65 or above continue to be employed, the corporate sector now consists of almost five generations of employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to the traditional prescription, the ‘tell-them-how; approach to management is being replaced by workplaces based on transparency, accountability and collaboration. If an organization is to thrive in this new paradigm, the onus lies on leaders to adapt and seek to gain competitive advantages through an effective evolution in strategy, before they lose ground to competitors who are more clued-in. In my own experience in such roles, I have found that striking a balance between stability and constant responsive change, is often the key to acting in the best interest of one’s organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leadership skills to consider, going forward</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, the complexity of business operations has increased in recent years, as the market is subjected to greater competitiveness and less ‘set-in-stone’ methodologies. This necessitates innovative new solutions, and a proactive rather than reactive approach. Leaders are increasingly required to take on the role of change-agents, and churn out future-proof solutions that include emerging strategies, technologies and business practices. For instance, being &#8220;tech-savvy&#8221; is an indispensible aspect of a contemporary leader’s playbook. As technologies such as AI, IoT and Big Data continue to make inroads into business operations, the new corporate culture needs to be responsive to changes in both operations and human resource management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, I feel many of the changes that leaders need to respond to are those happening in society at large, not just within the corporate environment. We cannot hope to be effective as leaders if we downplay cultural awareness and sensitivity, especially in the context of marginalized and previously disenfranchised groups. Age-agnostic policies and inclusiveness across gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation is an inevitable evolution in workplaces that leaders need to be seen to be supportive of. Such diversity is also known to bring multiple perspectives to the table, paving the way for comprehensive and effective problem-solving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Employee engagement is increasingly becoming a major talking point, supported by claims that profitability is significantly higher, in highly-engaged teams. In my opinion, creating open lines of communication and overall transparency goes a long way towards building employee trust and boosting morale in the face of routine change. I have found it very helpful to work on my own awareness and emotional intelligence, to better equip myself, and in turn empower my team members and forge future leaders. Emotional intelligence enables leaders to be receptive to change and open to new, alternative ideas. Once you facilitate collaboration instead of coaxing, employees become invested in the outcome, which also creates a healthy environment of accountability in workplaces. As the world gets more connected, any employee infraction or unethical behaviour can trace back to the employer. Increased employee accountability allays fears of bad PR, and leaders can stay focused on addressing critical business goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Embracing change</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With competition becoming fiercer by the day, leaders need to constantly enrich their critical thinking, judgement, decision-making and negotiation abilities. Successful businesses are emphasizing wisdom-based leadership, as opposed to knowledge-based practices. This makes sense to me, personally, as well. Wisdom-based leadership and business practices can help distinguish organizations, enhance integrity, build deeper customer engagement and foster much more innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When all is said and done, I believe leaders can better address the changing circumstances through the process of self-discovery, understanding their own motivations, strengths and shortcomings. The future belongs to altruistic—not egocentric—leaders, who can strike a healthy balance between employee well-being and capacity building. A leader becomes effective not only through their own actions or inactions, but by making other people do great things, and it this will hold true for generations to come—across disciplines and continents.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Managing Change: Reframing the role of leadership in the era of constant evolution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 80s, when the AIDS epidemic was sending shockwaves in the global public consciousness, misunderstandings about the disease were commonplace. The average person was isolating themselves from those who had tested HIV positive, to the extent that they refrained from even touching patients. It was then that a simple gesture of compassion from Princess Diana made a huge difference. A cultural and fashion icon, she was also known for her humanitarian work. Some would say she was the most celebrated public figure of that decade, who was constantly in the limelight. Once, after inaugurating the UK&#8217;s first purpose built HIV/AIDS unit, Princess Diana shook the hands of an AIDS patient without wearing gloves. This simple and earnest act went on to change people&#8217;s attitude and perception of the disease forever, beyond geographical frontiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although a collective is always more powerful than any single individual, it is human nature that groups respond to gestures, acts and words from those who they perceive as being in a leadership role. From public life, to sports and business, teams respond to cues from those at the helm and this is perhaps the single most important role of such a person. The role of a leader is not to issue orders, or even just to coordinate efforts and processes. It is to act in such a way as to manifest and empower what is best about the entire collective. Change is something that challenges us, especially as a group, which can find it harder to arrive at a common purpose and opinion for everyone to get behind. At such times, the most critical value that a leader can add to their organization, nation or society, is acting as a medium for what is sensible, decent and right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Change and business leaders</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the recession of 2008, industry stalwarts began exploring different avenues and adopting alternative methodologies to avert future financial calamities. Business leaders have since concerned themselves with issues that were traditionally considered as falling within the purview of governing bodies and NGOs. In the last decade businesses have come to prioritize many progressive issues, such as inclusiveness, employee welfare, accountability and corporate social responsibility (CSR), often within a resource-constrained framework. Without excessively focusing on short-term returns, business leaders have embraced long-term value generation and capacity building. This is a welcome change, but present-day economic policies, political events and cultural changes present even more challenges for leaders to respond to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion business leaders should invest in the creation of a flexible and responsive culture, as opposed to a static framework. A prescriptive, ‘tell-them-how’ approach to management is now obsolete, and with change accelerating, it is likely to become more and more ineffective. Leaders must be careful not to rationalize change from a cost standpoint alone, and neglect emotional aspects. For me, sensitivity is one of the most important strengths a contemporary leader can have. Especially when it comes to an emphasis on relating to employees as individuals, and trying to create inspiration rather than just compliance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be a business imperative to communicate and contextualize change to employees, so as to induce a transformation that is ground up, rather than top-down. Change management is a process that needs to be tended to constantly. Leaders have to continuously align new strategies with core competencies, and chart new paths using precedents from past changes, with across-the-board involvement. Trying to force an organization onto a new path or adopting a new culture is counterproductive, especially when much smoother transition can be facilitated through consensus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe leaders should stay abreast of current affairs and emerging trends, as well as skilling themselves effectively, so they incorporate changing contexts into their mindset. Regardless of models, businesses are becoming increasingly considerate of end user expectations. In order to leverage customer-centric market opportunities, leaders must first learn to address and incorporate change themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The connected world has empowered leaders to embrace change far beyond their own personal experience. Public debates, conferences and events offer a great opportunity for leaders to engage with professionals from different domains and the general public. Together with their teams, leaders can conduct workshops, share knowledge and embrace change, rather than being intimidated by it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leaders must hold themselves responsible to contributing to a better tomorrow</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that we were inspired by a generation of leaders before us. More often than not, these were individuals to opened doors to new thoughts and enabled positive changes to come about. In fulfilling our role, before we pass on the torch to the next generation, we too must respond to constant evolution by using our discerning minds to identify those changes that contribute to a better tomorrow, and empower them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dubai’s new JOP law: How do things change between Facilities Management (FM) and Owner Associations (OAs)?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Facilities Managers and Owners’ Associations are sometimes perceived as being two entities at odds with each other. It’s likely that you have come across that view before, or it might even be a perspective that you share. Nevertheless, operating from such a presumption isn’t inevitable. After all, both entities worked towards a common goal – that of maintaining a property in optimum condition and ensuring delightful tenant experiences. Recent developments, in regulations that govern jointly owned properties, are a good reason to revisit presumptions about this relationship, no matter where one has stood on the subject, in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Law No. (6) of 2019 &#8211; which concerns the joint ownership of real estate in Dubai – came into effect on the 18<sup>th</sup> of November this year, and one of the key changes it enforces is the abolition of existing OAs and the transfer of rights and obligations to management entities (MEs).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>No OA, but owners’ committees </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you are the owner of such a property, and are wondering if entrusting a new entity with such crucial responsibilities will cause too much of a disruption? Rest assured, if anything, under the new regulatory framework RERA can monitor the proper management of JOPs far more directly. The upshot of the rejigged regulations is likely to be better management of common areas and building structures. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an owner, you might also wonder if the fact that OAs are no longer legal entities will alter what you have come to expect of FM companies?  Well, the new law goes to great lengths to define the roles of developers, OAs and FM service providers. In the reconfigured model OAs will be replaced by “owners’ committees” &#8211; who must meet certain eligibility criteria. If you have an existing owners’ association, you will need to ensure the transition to an owners’ committee, no later than 17 May 2020. The managing bodies or MEs, which will take on many of the responsibilities that OAs previously governed, will be either developers or trained property management companies appointed by the developer, via RERA-approved contracts. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So how is this different from the past? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the now defunct Law No. 27 of 2007, Facility management companies operated as independent contractors who provided services such as cleaning of windows and common areas, landscaping, MEP etc., while the community manager addressed big-picture community needs and goals. An easy way to demarcate these roles is to consider what the functions of these entities would have been in a hypothetical situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, if there was a disruption in community services at 3 in the morning, who would be the first responder? As the administrative head, the OA manager would have ensured that the right experts were in place to take care of such operational needs, so the duty in question would be handled by the FM service provider. In fact, the FM manager and his team would always the ones to spring to action when dealing with any issues across functional requirements such as security, parking, lighting, lifts, HVAC etc. The OA manager, one the other hand, would be the one negotiating service level agreements, ensuring that the expectations of owners were adequately served, and other such overarching concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MEs take centre stage and RERA gets more hands-on </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the OAs no longer in charge, MEs are now responsible for many of the responsibilities that owners previously executed. Some of the advantages of taking this approach include leaving crucial operations in the hands of professionals. Owners’ committees take on more of a monitoring role, under the regulatory guidance of RERA, which more accurately reflects their status as customers receiving a service. MEs, on the other hand, will perform the managerial functions and assume the responsibility of sticking to regulatory guidelines.  At the top of the regulatory framework, as the body conducting inspections, monitoring adherence to law and assessing the efficiency of the FMs and MEs, is RERA. Leaving you, the property owner, in safe hands and with your needs met and rights ensured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, what do these changes mean for FM companies? Although some of the rules governing them are now more stringent, much of their day to day approach is largely unaffected. FM companies will now be required to submit reports to RERA every six months &#8211; on the management of the JOP – but in most other ways they will continue to function much like they had in the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the overall maintenance of community assets and quality of services as a focus, the new reassigned roles will result in a far more accountable management of jointly owned properties. As the owner, it’s the quality of your everyday living experiences and the value of your property, which the new JOP regulations ultimately secure more effectively. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Customer-facing FM employees are the brand ambassadors for properties and service providers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary customers are not merely buying a product or availing a service, they are rather buying into an experience or an idea. In response, businesses have shifted their focus to facilitating these priorities, keeping the needs of their end users paramount. This realignment also holds true of facility managers, who have witnessed significant transformation in their roles and responsibilities in recent years, transitioning from service providers to customer-facing experience managers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Business branding is now about tangible customer benefits</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marketing, advertising and driving brand awareness are often high on the priority list of building owners. Branding is vital in helping commercial real estate businesses retain their existing tenants, besides attracting potential new clients and securing the perceived value of a property. Traditionally, one of the strategies used to enhance brand perception was to collaborate with celebrity endorsees, introducing them as brand ambassadors in advertising and other marketing strategies. With customers exhibiting increasingly sophisticated and discerning behavior, this conventional understanding of the term &#8216;brand ambassador&#8217; is being reconsidered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lately, FM employees, who are of often the face of a commercial real estate operation by virtue of their visibility, have begun to assume the role of influencers, on the basis of their interactions with building occupants and the quality of the services they provide. In effect, these workforces are emerging as facilitators of customer experiences, and consequently brand ambassadors of a different variety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This new branding strategy is down to multiple reasons. Customers increasingly assess brands on the basis of whether or not they are receiving consistently high quality experiences, across an entire spectrum of their needs, as opposed to corporate marketing. The natural response to this trend is evident in the new-found popularity of employee ambassadorship programs, within customer-centric organizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The inherent strengths of making employees brand ambassadors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Employee engagement has been proven productive in terms of motivating, empowering and engaging the workforce. Engaged FM employees are natural brand ambassadors, capable of connecting with end users and promoting the business. In a built environment, FM employees and customers tend to interact with each other on a regular basis. This has come to amplify the impact of the quality and manner of service delivery, with customers giving far more credibility to routine interactions, in comparison to corporate advertising. In fact, according to one estimate, employee interactions were found to be eight times more effective than corporate marketing strategies. Positive employee interactions translate to better customer retention, and give advocacy marketing initiatives a context, as well as a far more receptive audience, in a crowded market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning employees into brand ambassadors comes with hardly any pressures, in terms of additional investment and ROI concerns. In fact, in some instances, engaged FM employees have driven profitability and customer loyalty, while management has concurrently cut costs associated with external branding services. Compared to the revenue generated, costs incurred through in-house employee ambassador programs are nominal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A closer look at the intricacies involved</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A critical part of ensuring the success of such programs is staff buy-in. FM leaders should address the &#8220;what&#8217;s-in-it-for-me?&#8221; question from employees. In order to do this, the program must clearly articulate its big picture benefits. Performance related bonuses, a chance for employees to enhance their professional skills and career opportunities, as well as the creation of a business-wide aspiration for excellence, are all valid means to achieve this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ambassador programs usually include soft skills training, general awareness on emerging trends, understanding of company goals, access to resource materials, and lessons on how to use them, among other elements. Measures should be taken to ensure the programs are fun and interactive, so that it does not become burdensome and time-consuming task, perceived by employees as a distraction or additional workload. Such initiatives should also be periodically updated in response to disruptive events and change. Employee ambassadors who excel in their roles, and bring about tangible benefits, should be rewarded with approbation, salary bonuses and promotions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The bottomline</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major roadblocks to effective employee engagement in contemporary business culture is impersonal interactions. Be it HR programs, information flow, work delegation and more, business processes are devoid of personalization, which has inhibited employee potential. Aristotle, the great Greek philosopher, is reputed to have said, “pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work&#8221;. The commonsensical truism of these words will remain valid in any era. Human contact creates the most deep seated goodwill for a brand, among customers, and FM employees are in a unique position to constantly reinforce this positive perception, through excellence in their everyday activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we ask ourselves who knows the brand best, the answer is &#8217;employees&#8217;. They are privy to organizational inner workings as much as they are aware of end user expectations. While traditional corporate branding strategies have broader reach, they fail to connect with customers on a personal level; an area where employee brand ambassadors excel. Properties managed by motivated FM employees run efficiently, leading to positive effect on key performance indicators (KPIs). Service providers, on the other hand, can unlock the economic benefits of employee engagement and in-house ambassador programmes, which are designed to help employees illuminate their blind spots and hidden strengths.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Facilities Management can be a core driver of value in the wider UAE economy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The facilities management function of commercial real estate industry is undergoing a sea-change. It’s evolution from a passive cost centre to unlocking unprecedented value from existing assets and unused data, is currently the proverbial toast of the town. In a world seeking to reconcile economic growth with sustainability, and a business climate coming to grips with far more discerning customer behaviour, facilities management has emerged as the silver bullet solution that can address all of these concerns and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Modern and agile FM is intrinsically linked to the vision of a prosperous and future-ready UAE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the context of the UAE, the positive economic impetus, which the FM function now has the potential to unleash, has even greater significance than in many other markets. Real estate has long been recognized as having a significant impact on the nation’s economy. Exceptional quality has been the calling card of the sector in the UAE, with luxury real estate sales making up a significant chunk of <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/property/424921-dubais-luxury-property-market-attracting-more-foreign-investors">international investments</a>. As modern and technology enabled FM reframes what is possible, its adoption will play a huge part in ensuring the UAE real estate market continues to be identified with the highest global standards in quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Expo 2020 on the horizon and the hospitality and F&amp;B sector already contributing <a href="https://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/business/111838-hospitality-fb-sector-contributes-51-to-dubais-gdp-in-h1-2019">more than 5%</a> to national GDP, providing next-level customer experiences is also linked to the adoption of proactive management and predictive maintenance of facilities. In addition, for the UAE to prosper economically, while also addressing its <a href="https://uaesdgs.ae/en/goals">ambitious sustainability goals</a>, embracing state of the art FM will be non-negotiable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A growth in numbers that can be enhanced by an evolution in services and performance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a relative lull over the last few years, the UAE real estate market has started to bounce back noticeably. The Dubai Land Department recorded the highest number of real estate transactions in a single month since 2008, <a href="https://www.constructionweekonline.com/business/260351-october-2019-sees-11-year-high-in-dubai-real-estate-transactions">in October 2019</a>. November the 24<sup>th</sup> set the <a href="https://gulfbusiness.com/dubai-sets-new-record-number-single-day-property-transactions/">record for a single day</a>, over the same 11 years. A robust upswing over two consecutive months indicates that the market has probably bottomed out and a new period of expansion is steadily taking root.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Knight Frank’s ‘UAE Market Review and Forecast 2019’ <a href="https://content.knightfrank.com/research/1064/documents/en/uae-market-review-forecast-2019-6072.pdf">report</a> estimates that 24,300 apartments, 8,500 villas and 3.6 million sq. ft. of office space will have been added to the Dubai property market in  2019, as well as an additional 3.7 million sq. mts. of retail space by 2024. The report also expects 165,000 sq. mts. of commercial real estate and 650,000 sq. mts of retail space to be added in Abu Dhabi, by 2020. The new model of empowered and value generating FM will play a crucial role in ensuring that this impressive additional volume can be leveraged to its maximum potential, in service of the UAE economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why the UAE is one of the best positioned markets, for the adoption of FM as a key enabler</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To their credit, the UAE government and real estate regulatory bodies have recognized this potential and have taken several measures to leverage the upcoming period of growth, expected by market watchers. From the Mollak system and new JOP laws, to the roadmap for the development of Smart Cities and adoption of Blockchain technology, the transformative power of technology is being paired with innovative reforms, to bring an ambitious vision to life. An evolution in FM is the logical next step, for this gathering momentum to deliver optimal results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The buzz around FM, in global markets, real estate conferences and strategic recommendations, is palpable. Along with Proptech, the facilities management function is currently the topic of some of the most energizing conversations in the industry. The commercial real estate industry in the UAE is well positioned to be a global leader in driving the adoption of next generation facilities management. The convergence of available capital, political will, a dynamic real estate industry, and a business culture that is open to disruptive technologies, is a potent combination. As a market that has always taken pride in reaching for the unprecedented, the UAE real estate community can set the template for the widespread deployment of responsive, data-driven and tech-enabled FM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FM is the key to turning this gathering momentum into real world enhancements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it’s leaner and more agile operational models for real estate businesses, state of the art comforts and conveniences for occupants, significant improvement in the sustainability profile of buildings, or a hospitality and tourism sector that attracts visitors from every corner of the globe, facilities management holds the key to transforming and upgrading each of these outcomes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No longer restricted in scope to operations with limited strategic impact, FM is now centre stage and staking new avenues for growth while consolidating existing ones. With the UAE property markets steadily gathering impetus for their next phase of growth, the influence of this new and more central role for FM will extend far beyond the real estate industry, to infusing the wider UAE economy with greater energy and dynamism.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability &amp; Green Initiatives from a Community Management perspective</strong></p>
<p>Are our modern conveniences and facilities inherently at odds with a more sustainable world? Not if we can replace wasteful practices with sustainable and green alternatives. Managing facilities at a community scale can transform our world, by making sustainability a matter of adding up positives.</p>
<p>From periodic maintenance to everyday consumption, the opportunities to deploy green solutions are everywhere. Water-wise measures can reduce the volume we use for landscaping and cleaning. Innovative technologies can reduce our dependence on harmful chemicals, for hygiene necessities like pest control and water tank cleaning. LED lighting, efficient elevator systems, real time and responsive automation of HVAC systems, and demand controlled ventilation are only a few measures – among countless more – which can each be used to reduce the drain on resources, while still delivering outstanding and best-in-class results. The true value of community management lies in being able to stack all these positives as one optimal and synergistic system, which evolves constantly as new innovations emerge.</p>
<p>Speaking from a personal standpoint, finding myself in a role where I can actively contribute to a more sustainable world is perhaps one of my greatest sources of satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Creating sustainable solutions by integrating communities</strong></p>
<p>Community management, as a means to create optimal sustainability, is not an entirely new concept. The centralized facilities management of commercial real estate has demonstrated what can be achieved in buildings, at the level of a single location as well as across an entire portfolio.</p>
<p>Technology is the core enabler that is driving this new vision for infrastructure and facilities. For instance, the energy consumption of community scale temperature control and air quality management is vastly lower. Energy savings to the tune of 15 to 20% have been achieved by taking this approach to lighting, HVAC, pumps and other traditionally consumption heavy amenities. Networking gadgets and automation, at a community scale, makes it possible to identify specific equipment that needs to be replaced or serviced. Not only does this ensure a seamless experience for occupants, it plugs energy inefficiencies that quickly add up. Introducing sensors, for common areas and commercial spaces, allows us to have responsive lighting and environment control, based on whether the space is occupied. Similarly, using sensors to take the guesswork out of controlling temperature and water quality, in swimming pools, ensures that the highest standards in hygiene and comfort coincide with the optimal use of energy.</p>
<p>Whether we consider cleaning, renewable energy, automation, security, waste disposal, or virtually any other aspect of managing a facility, community scale deployment unlocks both best case performance, as well as savings in cost and consumption, at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always been of the opinion that the most substantial way in which a great idea can be empowered is by implementing it in the best possible manner.</p>
<p>Several of our recent initiatives at Meridian Prime Facilities Management Services LLC have centered on bringing sustainable tech-enabled community management to market. With our fleet of energy efficient street cleaning trucks, we have been able to deploy a single solution that optimizes quality of life, hygiene and energy efficiency, at the same time. We have introduced cleaning systems that use much less water and need minimal chemicals, while still providing results that are superior to previous technologies. We are investigating the use of robotics for cleaning high-rise facades and expanding our capabilities to include many more innovative strategies, to help create the sustainable and green communities of the future. In recognition of this commitment, Meridian Prime Facilities Management Services LLC Facilities Management was awarded the ISO 41001:2018 accreditation in September 2019, the world’s first international Facilities Management System.</p>
<p>Creating a sustainable and eco-friendly society, with a high standard of living for all, is no longer inconceivable, and tech-enabled community management will be a key strategy, for humanity to achieve this goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Managing inclement weather: How effective FM can help commercial properties prepare for heavy downpours and flooding </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone loves a bit of November rain, but the recent heavy downpour in Dubai took both residents and visitors by surprise. You may have seen news reports about the flooding in one of Dubai’s most prominent malls. Several businesses reported temporary closures and videos and images of people wading through the mall’s avenues were widely circulated on social media. Later reports clarified that heavy rainfall and strong winds had caused leakages in a few sections of the mall, leading to a few of the stores being flooded. The Pointe, a seafront property that hosts some of Dubai’s finest retail outlets and restaurants, presented an even tougher challenge for maintenance staff, because of its huge outdoor spaces. Usually one of its most attractive features, these wide expanses bore the brunt of the heavy rains and quickly led to major disruptions. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can imagine, when an emergency like this hits one of the world’s most visited shopping and leisure destinations, it not only leads to introspection about emergency response, but also the need for preventive measures. Needless to say, such incidents can put the safety of customers and visitors at risk, and if you are an unlucky tenant at an affected property, the adverse impact on your premises and goods could cause major losses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>An ounce of prevention</strong><strong> is worth a pound of cure</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increase in climate change-induced freak weather patterns is giving us good reason to plan for unforeseen events and having robust procedures in place for emergencies. With operations and maintenance being the domain of facilities management, so is disaster preparedness. As an FM company, you are expected to provide emergency maintenance, which is <em>unscheduled</em> action to restore disrupted services, planned maintenance, to a pre-determined schedule, and preventive maintenance, which typically consists of ongoing periodic inspections, cleaning and repairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most critical aspects of being prepared for extreme weather is making sure you understand your vulnerabilities and put plans in place. A few of the intangibles that you need to have addressed include:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li><strong>Realistic understanding of risk:</strong> Gaining a good understanding of the downside is essential. Risk analysis in your best approach to getting the most out of your planning and preparations.</li>
	<li><strong>Defining your ideal state of preparedness: </strong>Only when you have established the response capabilities you need can you achieve them and leave nothing to chance. <strong> </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Having a pre-determined response plan: </strong>Having identified your risks and defined your preparedness goals, you must next develop a detailed and pre-determined response for every combination of these variables.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proactive facilities management is the key to better preparedness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there was anything that the recent heavy showers in Dubai established, it was that leaving your response to after or during such a weather event, is to invite failure. Facilities management that primes the property for such happenings <em>in advance</em> is the need of the hour. Some of the simple but effective measures you can incorporate include:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li><strong>Well maintained parking, pavements and outdoor floors: </strong>Quick and effective drainage depends on the fact that outdoor areas are free of potholes and other indentations. Water that collects will cause damage and regular inspection of these often overlooked surfaces can be an important part of your preventive measures.</li>
	<li><strong>Ensuring roofs are in prime condition:</strong> Roofs are usually your single largest surface, in a relatively low-rise building. Over the course of the year’s changes in season, it is subjected to considerable stress. Ensuring that your property’s roof is immaculate can prevent and limit damage, in the event of sudden heavy precipitation.</li>
	<li><strong>Clean guttering ensures quick flow off:</strong> An issue allied to the condition of roofs is regular cleaning and maintenance of gutters. In the event of heavy rains, guttering is one of your most common bottlenecks, which can lead to water damage and service disruptions.</li>
	<li><strong>Sealing</strong> <strong>windows and edges: </strong>Anywhere two planes, surfaces or construction elements meet, presents torrential rains with a weakness to exploit. Sealing such edges is especially crucial in the case of windows, which can present a large surface area for weather phenomenon to impact.</li>
	<li><strong>Learn from experience and identify problem areas:</strong> No two properties are the same. Each individual location also represents a different set of challenges. Facilities management needs to build from each instance of heavy weather, to build on proactive and predictive measures, which address any weaknesses that previous instances have exposed.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan, prepare and prevent</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Facilities management is not just about ensuring that a property is optimized for planned use. It must also extend to proper preparedness for emergencies and prevention of undesirable outcomes. Being one step ahead of all eventualities is a core service that FM providers can extend to their clients. Your best bet is to spare no expense and take worst case scenarios into account, so nothing catches you by surprise and disruptions are kept to a minimum.</p>
